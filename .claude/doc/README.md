**Detailed instructions for applying universal templates**
- Template categories and usage patterns
- Customization process with placeholder variables
- Template copying and variable replacement procedures
- Cross-reference integration workflows
- Template maintenance and troubleshooting guide

### [Quality Assurance Standards](quality-assurance-standards.md)
**Comprehensive quality assessment and validation procedures**
- 100-point scoring system for integration completeness
- Directory structure validation checklists

- Integration lifecycle management procedures

## Quick Navigation

### For New Developers
1. Start with [Operational Context](operational-context.md) to understand the architecture
2. Review [Quality Assurance Standards](quality-assurance-standards.md) to understand expectations
3. Follow [Integration Creation Guide](integration-creation-guide.md) when creating new integrations

### For Existing Project Work
1. Use [Template Application Guide](template-application-guide.md) for template-related tasks
2. Reference [Quality Assurance Standards](quality-assurance-standards.md) for assessments
3. Consult [Operational Context](operational-context.md) for production environment details

### For Project Management
1. Review [Quality Assurance Standards](quality-assurance-standards.md) for maturity assessment
2. Reference [Integration Creation Guide](integration-creation-guide.md) for planning new integrations
3. Use [Operational Context](operational-context.md) for lifecycle management

## Integration with Main Documentation

These specialized guides work together with the main project documentation:

- **[CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)**: Core guidance and quick reference
- **[README.md](../README.md)**: Project overview and navigation hub
- **[Templates/](../Templates/)**: Universal templates referenced by these guides
- **Integration Directories**: Specific implementations following these standards

## Document Maintenance

These documentation files should be updated when:
- Universal templates are modified or added
- Quality assurance standards change
- Operational environment configurations update
- New integration creation processes are established
- Cross-reference systems are enhanced

All changes should maintain consistency with the main CLAUDE.md file and preserve cross-reference integrity across the entire project.
