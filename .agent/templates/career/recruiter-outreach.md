# Recruiter Outreach Workflow

When a recruiter reaches out (LinkedIn, email) before user actively applies:

1. **Log the interaction** in `interactions.md` immediately with full message content
2. **Extract what's known**: company, role, recruiter name, any links provided
3. **Create application directory** with partial info
4. **Fetch JD** from provided link or ask recruiter for details
5. **Draft response options** for user to choose from (formal, warm, minimal)
6. **Research company** proactively if user expresses interest
7. **Assess intent**: Is this a Target, Practice, or Exploratory opportunity?

## Intent Categories

- **Target**: Serious interest, would accept offer if right
- **Practice**: Low stakes, use for interview practice & market intel
- **Exploratory**: Curious but uncertain about fit
