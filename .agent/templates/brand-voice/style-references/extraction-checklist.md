# Extraction Checklist

What to extract — and what NOT to extract — when analyzing external creators for voice inspiration. Use this checklist to ensure every reference analysis stays within ethical boundaries.

## Purpose

This checklist serves as a validation gate during the Analyst mode workflow. Complete it after filling out the `reference-analysis-template.md` and before adding an entry to the `inspiration-library-template.md`.

## EXTRACT: Reusable Principles

### Tone Characteristics

- [ ] **Overall tone positioning**: Where the creator sits on formality, energy, warmth, authority, humor scales
- [ ] **Tone consistency**: Whether tone is uniform or varies by section/content type
- [ ] **Tone shifts**: How the creator transitions between tones within a piece (e.g., serious to lighthearted)
- [ ] **Register level**: General vocabulary complexity and reading level
- [ ] **Emotional range**: What emotions the content typically evokes (curiosity, urgency, comfort, etc.)

### Structural Patterns

- [ ] **Opening techniques**: Categories of openers used (question, statistic, anecdote, bold claim, etc.)
- [ ] **Closing techniques**: How pieces wrap up (CTA, summary, open question, callback, etc.)
- [ ] **Paragraph rhythm**: Short/long paragraph alternation patterns
- [ ] **Sentence length variation**: How sentence length is mixed for readability
- [ ] **Section organization**: How the body is structured (problem-solution, chronological, modular, etc.)
- [ ] **Heading strategy**: Frequency, style, and function of headings
- [ ] **White space usage**: How visual breathing room is used for effect
- [ ] **List integration**: When and how lists are used vs. continuous prose

### Engagement Techniques

- [ ] **Reader address pattern**: How and when the creator speaks directly to the reader
- [ ] **Question usage**: Rhetorical questions, frequency, and placement
- [ ] **Curiosity gaps**: How the creator creates and resolves information gaps
- [ ] **Pacing techniques**: How momentum is built, maintained, or intentionally slowed
- [ ] **Pattern breaks**: Methods used to recapture attention mid-piece
- [ ] **Proof integration**: How evidence, data, or social proof is woven in
- [ ] **Repetition for emphasis**: Strategic repetition of concepts (not phrases)

### Storytelling Approaches

- [ ] **Narrative frequency**: How often stories appear and their role in content
- [ ] **Story types used**: Categories (personal, case study, hypothetical, historical)
- [ ] **Story placement**: Where narratives appear in the content structure
- [ ] **Narrative arc patterns**: Setup-tension-resolution or variations
- [ ] **Perspective choices**: First/second/third person for stories
- [ ] **Detail level**: How much sensory or situational detail is included

### Vocabulary & Language Patterns

- [ ] **Complexity level**: Simple, moderate, advanced, or intentionally mixed
- [ ] **Jargon handling**: How technical terms are introduced, defined, or avoided
- [ ] **Verb energy**: Active/passive preference, verb strength patterns
- [ ] **Modifier approach**: Sparse vs. rich use of adjectives and adverbs
- [ ] **Contraction style**: Whether contractions are used and how consistently
- [ ] **Transition method**: How ideas connect (explicit connectors, implied flow, visual breaks)

## DO NOT EXTRACT: Protected Elements

These elements are unique to the creator and must never be captured, cataloged, or reproduced.

### Specific Content

- [ ] **Exact phrases or sentences** — Never copy verbatim text, even short fragments
- [ ] **Signature expressions** — Catchphrases, taglines, or recurring verbal tics unique to the creator
- [ ] **Coined terminology** — Words or terms the creator invented or popularized
- [ ] **Specific metaphors** — Particular metaphors or analogies that are recognizably theirs
- [ ] **Original frameworks** — Named frameworks, models, or methodologies they created
- [ ] **Personal anecdotes** — Their specific stories, experiences, or biographical details

### Unique Ideas

- [ ] **Original theses** — The creator's unique arguments or intellectual positions
- [ ] **Proprietary insights** — Research findings, data, or conclusions they produced
- [ ] **Unique perspectives** — Distinctive viewpoints that are identifiably theirs
- [ ] **Content strategy** — Their specific editorial calendar, series structure, or content system

### Identity Elements

- [ ] **Personal brand markers** — Visual style, naming conventions, personal branding elements
- [ ] **Community references** — Inside jokes, community terminology, or audience-specific references
- [ ] **Relationship language** — How they specifically address their audience (e.g., a unique greeting)

## Validation Gate

After completing extraction, run this final validation. **All items must pass** for the analysis to proceed to the inspiration library.

### Principle-Level Validation

For each extracted principle, confirm:

| # | Principle Name | Technique Not Signature? | Transferable? | No Verbatim Content? | No Coined Terms? | Pass? |
|---|---------------|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 1 | [Name] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| 2 | [Name] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| 3 | [Name] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |

**Column definitions**:
- **Technique Not Signature?** — The principle describes a general technique, not something uniquely identified with this creator
- **Transferable?** — Any brand could use this principle and sound like themselves, not like the source creator
- **No Verbatim Content?** — No exact phrases, sentences, or distinctive word combinations from the creator's content
- **No Coined Terms?** — No terminology invented or strongly associated with this creator

### Entry-Level Validation

- [ ] Creator is fully attributed (name, platform, URL)
- [ ] Analysis date is recorded
- [ ] At least 3 samples were analyzed
- [ ] All principles pass principle-level validation above
- [ ] Adaptation notes explain how to make principles brand-specific
- [ ] No principle, if applied, would make the output sound like a copy of the source

### The "Swap Test"

Final gut check: **If you replaced the creator's name with any other creator's name, would the extracted principles still make sense and not feel like they "belong" to someone specific?**

- [ ] **Yes** — Principles are properly abstracted. Proceed.
- [ ] **No** — Principles are too specific to this creator. Revise before proceeding.

## Common Extraction Mistakes

| Mistake | Example | Correction |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Copying a phrase as a "principle" | "Use 'Here's the thing' as a transition" | "Use a conversational pivot phrase before key points" |
| Describing content instead of technique | "Write about morning routines" | "Use personal routine narratives as opening hooks" |
| Including creator-specific context | "Reference Silicon Valley startup culture" | "Use domain-specific cultural references the audience identifies with" |
| Capturing a signature format | "Write a 'Friday Five' listicle" | "Use recurring numbered-list formats for serialized content" |
| Over-attributing generic techniques | "Inspired by [Creator]: use short paragraphs" | Short paragraphs are universal — no need to attribute to a specific creator |

## QG-BV-6 Compliance

This checklist directly enforces **QG-BV-6 (External Reference Ethics)**. An analysis is QG-BV-6 compliant when:

1. Every "DO NOT EXTRACT" item is confirmed as excluded
2. Every extracted principle passes the principle-level validation table
3. The entry-level validation is complete with all boxes checked
4. The Swap Test passes
5. Creator attribution is complete and accurate

**If any validation fails**: Revise the principle to increase abstraction, or remove it from the extraction entirely. Document the removal and reason in the analysis notes.
