# Instagram Channel Rules

Rules for adapting brand voice to Instagram's visual-first format.

## Platform Characteristics

- Visual-first platform; image/video quality is non-negotiable
- Feed posts, Stories (24h), Reels (short video), Carousels (up to 20 slides)
- Captions: up to 2,200 characters but truncated at ~125 in feed
- Hashtags: up to 30; algorithm uses them for discoverability
- Strong on mobile; all content must be mobile-optimized
- Algorithm rewards saves, shares, and comments over likes

## Audience Expectations

- **Primary**: Visual learners, younger professionals, brand followers
- **Mindset**: Browsing, discovering, seeking quick inspiration or insight
- **Tolerance**: Very low tolerance for text-heavy or dry content; high for visual creativity
- **Engagement**: Expect polished visuals with bite-sized, immediately useful text

## Tone Guidelines

| Dimension | Setting | Notes |
|-----------|:-------:|-------|
| Formality | 2/5 | Casual, approachable, human |
| Energy | 4/5 | Vibrant, inspiring, dynamic |
| Warmth | 4/5 | Friendly, inclusive |
| Authority | 2-3/5 | Confident but not lecturing |

**Tone shifts by content type**:
- Carousel / educational: Authority +1, structured teaching
- Reel / demo: Energy +1, fast-paced and engaging
- Story / behind-the-scenes: Formality -1, raw and authentic
- Quote / insight: Authority +1, Warmth stays high

## Format Constraints

### Feed Post Structure
1. **Visual**: High-quality image or designed graphic; consistent brand palette
2. **First line** (visible before truncation): Hook or key insight — ~125 chars
3. **Caption body**: Expand on the insight; 2-5 short paragraphs
4. **CTA**: Save this, share with a colleague, drop a comment
5. **Hashtags**: 5-15 relevant tags; in caption or first comment

### Carousel Structure
- **Slide 1**: Title slide — bold statement or question
- **Slides 2-9**: One point per slide; minimal text (< 30 words per slide)
- **Final slide**: Summary + CTA (follow, save, share)
- Consistent design template across all slides
- Text must be readable without zooming (min 24pt equivalent)

### Reel Guidelines
- 15-60 seconds optimal; 30s sweet spot
- Hook in first 2 seconds — text overlay or visual grab
- Captions/subtitles mandatory (most watch without sound)
- Trending audio can boost reach but must fit brand voice
- End with a clear CTA on screen

### Story Guidelines
- Use interactive elements: polls, questions, quizzes, sliders
- Mix designed slides with casual/authentic content
- Highlight important stories into themed collections
- Link stickers for driving traffic

## Best Practices

- **Visual consistency** — maintain brand color palette, typography, and layout templates
- **Bite-sized value** — one clear insight or tip per post; save depth for carousels
- **Captions matter** — even on a visual platform, strong captions drive saves and shares
- **Use alt text** — describe images for accessibility; also helps SEO
- **Post carousels for education** — they outperform single images for engagement and saves
- **Stories for authenticity** — behind-the-scenes, quick takes, polls, real-time content
- **Engage in DMs and comments** — Instagram rewards conversations
- **Cross-post strategically** — Reels can also go to Stories and feed; adjust format slightly

## Examples

### Good Reel Hook (text overlay + voiceover)
```
[Text on screen]: "One command that saved my deployment"
[Voiceover]: "This single Ansible check prevented a production
outage — here's what it does."
