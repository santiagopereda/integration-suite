# YouTube Channel Rules

Rules for adapting brand voice to YouTube video content and descriptions.

## Platform Characteristics

- Video-first platform with strong search and recommendation engine
- Content persists and compounds; discoverability improves over time
- Title + thumbnail drive click-through; first 30 seconds drive retention
- Description and tags support SEO; chapters improve navigation
- Comments are a community-building surface
- Supports shorts (< 60s), standard (5-20 min), and long-form (20+ min)

## Audience Expectations

- **Primary**: Learners, practitioners, evaluators wanting to see things in action
- **Mindset**: "Show me, don't just tell me"; visual and auditory learning
- **Tolerance**: Low tolerance for slow intros; high tolerance for depth if well-paced
- **Engagement**: Expect demonstrations, clear explanations, practical walkthroughs

## Tone Guidelines

| Dimension | Setting | Notes |
|-----------|:-------:|-------|
| Formality | 2-3/5 | Conversational, like explaining to a smart colleague |
| Energy | 4/5 | Engaging, enthusiastic but not performative |
| Warmth | 4/5 | Welcoming; the viewer should feel included |
| Authority | 3-4/5 | Confident but open to alternatives |

**Tone shifts by content type**:
- Tutorial: Warmth +1, pacing is patient and clear
- Demo / showcase: Energy +1, excitement about what's possible
- Explainer / concept: Authority +1, measured and precise
- Live / Q&A: Formality -1, spontaneous and reactive

## Format Constraints

### Video Structure
1. **Hook** (0-15s): State what the viewer will learn/see — no long intros
2. **Context** (15-60s): Why this matters, who it's for
3. **Core content**: Logical sections matching chapter markers
4. **Recap** (last 30-60s): Key takeaways, next steps
5. **CTA**: Subscribe, watch next video, try it yourself

### Script/Narration Rules
- Use "you" and "we" — speak directly to the viewer
- Short sentences; natural speech rhythm with pauses
- Signpost transitions: "Now that we've set up X, let's move to Y"
- Avoid reading from a script verbatim — bullet-point delivery feels more natural
- Say the video's value proposition in the first 10 seconds

### Description Template
```
[One-sentence summary of what the video covers]

In this video, you'll learn:
- [Key point 1]
- [Key point 2]
- [Key point 3]

Chapters:
0:00 - Introduction
[X:XX] - [Section name]
[X:XX] - [Section name]

Resources mentioned:
- [Link 1]
- [Link 2]

[Standard channel CTA and links]
```

### Thumbnail & Title Rules
- Title: Under 60 characters; front-load the keyword
- Thumbnail: High contrast, readable text (3-4 words max), expressive imagery
- Avoid ALL CAPS clickbait; clear benefit or curiosity gap instead

## Best Practices

- **Start with the result** — show the end state in the first 15 seconds, then teach how to get there
- **Use chapters** — every video over 5 minutes should have timestamped chapters
- **Screen share with narration** — for technical content, show the real tool/code, not slides
- **Pace for retention** — cut dead air, filler words, and tangents in editing
- **Consistent structure** — viewers should know what to expect from your format
- **Pin a comment** — with links, corrections, or a follow-up question to drive engagement
- **Respond to comments** — within the first 24 hours; builds community and signals algorithm
- **Repurpose** — extract clips for Shorts, pull quotes for social, transcribe for blog posts

## Examples

### Good Hook
```
"Your Ansible playbooks are failing silently — and you might not even know it.
In the next 10 minutes, I'll show you how to add validation that catches
problems before they hit production. Let's dive in."
```

### Bad Hook
```
"Hey everyone, welcome back to the channel! So today I wanted to talk about
something that I've been thinking about for a while now, and I think you're
really going to enjoy this one. But first, make sure to like and subscribe
and hit that bell notification..."
```

### Good Transition
```
"Now that our inventory is set up, let's write the actual playbook.
I'm going to start with the simplest possible version, then add
error handling step by step."
```
