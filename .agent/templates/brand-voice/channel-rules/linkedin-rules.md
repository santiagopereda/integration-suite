# LinkedIn Channel Rules

Rules for adapting brand voice to LinkedIn's professional context.

## Platform Characteristics

- Professional networking platform with algorithm-driven feed
- Content indexed by search engines; high SEO value
- Character limit: ~3,000 for posts; articles are unlimited
- Rich media support: images, carousels, documents, polls, video
- Engagement signals: reactions (6 types), comments, shares, dwell time
- Algorithm favors native content over external links

## Audience Expectations

- **Primary**: Industry peers, potential clients, recruiters, partners
- **Mindset**: Career-focused, seeking value, networking, thought leadership
- **Tolerance**: Low tolerance for hype; high tolerance for depth and nuance
- **Engagement**: Expect professional insight, not sales pitches

## Tone Guidelines

| Dimension | Setting | Notes |
|-----------|:-------:|-------|
| Formality | 3-4/5 | Professional but not stiff |
| Energy | 3/5 | Confident, measured |
| Warmth | 3/5 | Approachable authority |
| Authority | 4/5 | Demonstrate expertise clearly |

**Tone shifts by post type**:
- Achievement/milestone: Energy +1, Warmth +1
- Industry commentary: Authority +1, Formality +1
- Personal story: Warmth +1, Formality -1
- How-to / tips: Energy +1, Authority stays high

## Format Constraints

### Post Structure
1. **Hook** (first 2 lines): Must earn the "see more" click
2. **Body**: Short paragraphs (1-2 sentences each), generous line breaks
3. **CTA**: Clear ask — comment, share, follow, visit link
4. **Hashtags**: 3-5 relevant tags at the end, not inline

### Formatting Rules
- One idea per line for readability in feed
- Use line breaks between paragraphs (LinkedIn collapses dense text)
- Bold sparingly for emphasis — LinkedIn supports basic markdown in articles only
- Bullets and numbered lists work well for tips/frameworks
- Avoid walls of text; max ~150 words before "see more" fold

### Media Guidelines
- Carousels outperform single images for educational content
- Native video (under 3 min) outperforms YouTube links
- Document uploads (PDFs) drive high dwell time

## Best Practices

- **Lead with value, not self-promotion** — teach, share frameworks, offer perspective
- **Show the work** — behind-the-scenes, lessons learned, real metrics
- **Engage in comments** — reply within the first hour; substantive comments, not "Thanks!"
- **Tag sparingly** — only tag people genuinely relevant; avoid engagement-bait tagging
- **Post consistently** — 2-4 posts per week; quality over quantity
- **Avoid link-in-first-post** — put links in first comment to avoid algorithm penalty
- **Use "I" more than "we"** — personal voice performs better than corporate voice on LinkedIn

## Examples

### Achievement Post (Good)
```
We reduced data pipeline failures by 73% in 6 months.

Here's what actually worked (and what didn't):

What failed:
- Adding more monitoring (just more noise)
- Bigger infrastructure (treating symptoms)

What worked:
1. Schema contracts between teams
2. Dead letter queues for every stage
3. Weekly data quality standups

The biggest shift wasn't technical — it was getting producers to own their data quality.

### Achievement Post (Bad)
```
THRILLED to announce our AMAZING new data platform!!! We're disrupting the industry with our innovative solution. Like and share if you agree that data is important! #Data #AI #ML #Innovation #Disruption #Excited
```

### Thought Leadership (Good)
```
Unpopular opinion: most companies don't need a data lake.

They need clean data in 3 well-modeled tables.

I've seen teams spend 18 months building a lake that nobody queries.
Meanwhile, a simple PostgreSQL view would have answered every question the CEO actually asks.

Before you architect, ask: what are the 5 questions the business needs answered this quarter?

Start there.
