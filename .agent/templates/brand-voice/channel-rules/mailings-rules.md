# Email / Mailings Channel Rules

Rules for adapting brand voice to email newsletters, campaigns, and transactional emails.

## Platform Characteristics

- Direct-to-inbox; competes with hundreds of daily emails for attention
- Subject line + preview text determine open rates
- Most emails read on mobile (60%+); design must be mobile-first
- HTML rendering varies across clients (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail)
- Trackable: open rates, click-through rates, unsubscribes
- Regulatory requirements: CAN-SPAM, GDPR consent, unsubscribe link

## Audience Expectations

- **Primary**: Subscribers who opted in — they expect value for their attention
- **Mindset**: Scanning inbox quickly; will archive/delete in 2-3 seconds if not hooked
- **Tolerance**: Low tolerance for frequency without value; zero tolerance for spam feel
- **Engagement**: Expect relevance, brevity, and a clear reason to open and read

## Tone Guidelines

| Dimension | Setting | Notes |
|-----------|:-------:|-------|
| Formality | 2-3/5 | Friendly professional; like an email from a knowledgeable colleague |
| Energy | 3-4/5 | Engaging, purposeful, not frantic |
| Warmth | 4/5 | Personal, direct, respectful of their time |
| Authority | 3/5 | Confident but not preachy |

**Tone shifts by email type**:
- Newsletter: Warmth +1, conversational and curated
- Product announcement: Energy +1, highlight impact
- Event invitation: Energy +1, create anticipation
- Transactional (receipts, alerts): Formality +1, minimal and clear
- Re-engagement: Warmth +1, gentle and low-pressure

## Format Constraints

### Email Structure
1. **Subject line**: Under 50 characters; benefit or curiosity-driven
2. **Preview text**: Extends the subject line; 40-90 characters
3. **Opening line**: Personal, direct; reward the open immediately
4. **Body**: 1-3 key points; scannable with short paragraphs
5. **CTA**: One primary CTA per email; make it visually clear
6. **Footer**: Unsubscribe link, company info, social links

### Subject Line Rules
- Front-load value: what will they get or learn?
- Avoid spam triggers: ALL CAPS, excessive punctuation (!!!), "Free", "Act now"
- Personalization (first name) sparingly — test effectiveness
- A/B test subjects when possible
- Questions and numbers perform well: "3 ways to..." or "Did you try...?"

### Body Formatting
- Paragraphs: 1-3 sentences max
- One idea per paragraph
- Use bold for key phrases (not entire sentences)
- Bullet points for lists of 3+ items
- Button CTAs over text links for primary action
- Images: compressed, with alt text, not for critical info (images blocked by default in many clients)

### Length Guidelines
| Email Type | Word Count | Read Time |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Newsletter | 200-500 | 2-3 min |
| Announcement | 100-250 | 1-2 min |
| Transactional | 50-150 | < 1 min |
| Event invite | 150-300 | 1-2 min |
| Re-engagement | 75-150 | < 1 min |

## Best Practices

- **Value first, ask second** — deliver insight or useful content before any CTA
- **One email, one goal** — don't combine a newsletter with a product pitch and an event invite
- **Respect the inbox** — send only when you have something worth saying; frequency without value kills lists
- **Write the subject line last** — after you know the email's best hook
- **Preview text is prime real estate** — don't waste it with "View in browser" or "Having trouble viewing?"
- **Segment your audience** — the same message shouldn't go to prospects and power users
- **Test on mobile** — preview in Gmail mobile, Apple Mail, Outlook before sending
- **Consistent send time** — train subscribers to expect your emails at a regular cadence
- **Make unsubscribing easy** — a clean list outperforms a large reluctant one

Hi [Name],

Last week, I reviewed 12 failed deployments across 3 teams.
Same root cause every time: environment variables that passed
in staging but didn't exist in production.

Here's a 3-step check that catches this before it reaches prod:
