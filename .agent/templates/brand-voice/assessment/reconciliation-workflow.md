# Brand Voice Reconciliation Workflow

Process for aligning multiple stakeholders on a unified brand voice.

## Phase 1: Individual Collection

1. Have each stakeholder independently complete:
   - 3 words that describe desired voice
   - 3 words that describe undesired voice
   - 2 content examples they love
   - 1 content example that feels wrong
   - Rank voice attributes by priority (1-5)

2. Collect without cross-influence (no group sessions first)

## Phase 2: Convergence Analysis

1. Map responses to find:
   - **Strong agreement**: Attributes chosen by 70%+ of stakeholders
   - **Moderate agreement**: Attributes chosen by 40-69%
   - **Conflicts**: Opposing preferences (e.g., "casual" vs. "formal")
   - **Unique insights**: Attributes from single stakeholder worth discussing

2. Create convergence matrix:

| Attribute | Stakeholder 1 | Stakeholder 2 | Stakeholder 3 | Agreement |
|-----------|:---:|:---:|:---:|-----------|
| [attribute] | Y/N | Y/N | Y/N | Strong/Moderate/Conflict |

## Phase 3: Conflict Resolution

For each conflict, apply resolution hierarchy:
1. **Audience data wins**: What resonates with the target audience?
2. **Brand strategy alignment**: Which option better serves positioning?
3. **Practical feasibility**: Which can the team consistently execute?
4. **Stakeholder priority**: Weighted by role relevance (CMO > engineer for marketing voice)

Document resolution rationale for each conflict.

## Phase 4: Unified Draft

1. Build draft voice profile from agreed attributes
2. Create 3 sample paragraphs demonstrating the unified voice
3. Share with all stakeholders for comment period (48 hours)
4. Collect written feedback (not verbal)

## Phase 5: Final Alignment

1. Address remaining feedback
2. Present final voice profile with:
   - What was agreed unanimously
   - What was resolved through hierarchy
   - What remains flexible (per-channel variation)
3. Obtain sign-off from each stakeholder

## Sign-Off Tracker

| Stakeholder | Role | Status | Date | Notes |
|-------------|------|--------|------|-------|
| [Name] | [Role] | Pending/Approved/Conditional | | |

## Review Cadence

- Initial review: 30 days after implementation
- Regular review: Per schedule set in voice profile
- Trigger review: Market shift, rebrand, stakeholder change
