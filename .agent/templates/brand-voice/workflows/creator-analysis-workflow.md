# Creator Analysis Workflow

Process for analyzing a creator's writing style and mapping it to voice profile format.

## Prerequisites

- 3-5 content samples from the creator (minimum 3)
- Samples should represent the creator's typical output
- Ideally from the same channel/context for consistency

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Collect Samples
1. Gather 3-5 representative content pieces
2. Note metadata: channel, date, audience, content type
3. Exclude outliers (guest posts, heavily edited pieces)

### Step 2: Structural Analysis

For each sample, extract:
- Average sentence length (words)
- Average paragraph length (sentences)
- Heading usage pattern
- List vs. prose ratio
- Content structure pattern (problem-solution, narrative, tutorial, etc.)

### Step 3: Linguistic Analysis

Across all samples, identify:
- **Word frequency**: Most-used significant words (exclude common words)
- **Sentence patterns**: Simple, compound, complex ratio
- **Voice**: Active vs. passive usage percentage
- **Person**: First (I/we), second (you), third usage
- **Rhetorical devices**: Questions, analogies, repetition, contrast
- **Transition style**: How ideas connect between paragraphs

### Step 4: Tone Mapping

Map observed patterns to tone dimensions:
- **Formality**: 1-5 based on language register
- **Energy**: 1-5 based on punctuation, word choice, pacing
- **Warmth**: 1-5 based on personal pronouns, empathy markers
- **Authority**: 1-5 based on hedging language, directive style

### Step 5: Attribute Extraction

Identify where the creator falls on common voice attribute spectrums:
- Simple ↔ Sophisticated
- Reserved ↔ Expressive
- Humble ↔ Commanding
- Serious ↔ Playful
- Measured ↔ Energetic

### Step 6: Output

Produce creator style profile containing:
1. Summary: 2-3 sentence description of the creator's voice
2. Tone scores (formality, energy, warmth, authority)
3. Attribute positions (on spectrums)
4. Signature patterns (distinctive style elements)
5. Vocabulary tendencies (preferred words, avoided patterns)
6. Compatibility notes: How this creator's style maps to the brand voice profile (if one exists)
