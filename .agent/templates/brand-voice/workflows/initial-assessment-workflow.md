# Initial Assessment Workflow

End-to-end process for discovering and documenting a brand's voice from scratch.

## Prerequisites

- Access to stakeholder(s) who can answer voice questions
- 2-3 existing content samples (if available)
- Understanding of target audience

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Prepare
1. Load `assessment/discovery-questionnaire.md`
2. Check if `.agent/system/brand-voice-profile.md` already exists
3. If exists: confirm whether to update or replace
4. Determine context: new brand, rebrand, or first-time documentation

### Step 2: Discovery Interview
1. Walk through questionnaire sections 1-11 adaptively
2. Skip sections that don't apply (e.g., Section 10 for new brands)
3. Capture verbatim stakeholder language — it reveals voice preferences
4. Note contradictions for later reconciliation
5. If multiple stakeholders: use Reconciler mode first

### Step 3: Content Analysis (if samples exist)
1. Analyze 3-5 content samples provided
2. Extract observed patterns: sentence length, word choice, tone markers
3. Compare observed patterns with stated preferences
4. Flag mismatches between what they say and what they do

### Step 4: Build Voice Profile
1. Load all `voice-profile/` templates
2. Define 3-5 voice principles from interview findings
3. Set tone matrix baseline and context shifts
4. Create vocabulary guide from language preferences
5. Define 4-6 voice attributes with target positions

### Step 5: Validate
1. Write 2-3 sample paragraphs using the new voice profile
2. Ask stakeholder(s) to react: "Does this sound like us?"
3. Iterate on profile based on feedback
4. Finalize voice profile

### Step 6: Save & Handoff
1. Write completed profile to `.agent/system/brand-voice-profile.md`
2. Summarize key voice principles for quick reference
3. Recommend next steps: content creation, team training, review schedule
