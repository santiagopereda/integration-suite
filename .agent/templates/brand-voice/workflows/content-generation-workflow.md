# Content Generation Workflow

Process for creating on-brand content using the voice profile.

## Prerequisites

- Voice profile exists at `.agent/system/brand-voice-profile.md`
- Content brief: type, channel, audience, purpose

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Load Context
1. Read `.agent/system/brand-voice-profile.md`
2. Identify relevant section of tone matrix (channel + audience + context)
3. Note applicable vocabulary rules
4. Check voice attribute targets for this content type

### Step 2: Content Planning
1. Clarify content requirements: topic, length, format, CTA
2. Identify key messages and supporting points
3. Determine structure (headings, sections, flow)
4. Select tone settings from matrix

### Step 3: Draft
1. Write content applying:
   - Voice principles as guardrails
   - Tone matrix settings for this context
   - Vocabulary guide for word choice
   - Voice attributes at target positions
2. Use preferred sentence patterns and paragraph length
3. Apply channel-specific formatting rules

### Step 4: Self-Review
1. Check each voice principle — does content follow it?
2. Verify tone matches matrix for this context
3. Scan for avoided words/phrases
4. Confirm voice attributes are at target positions
5. Verify inclusive language compliance

### Step 5: Deliver
1. Present content with brief voice notes:
   - Which tone settings were applied
   - Any deliberate deviations from profile (with rationale)
   - Suggested alternatives for key sections
