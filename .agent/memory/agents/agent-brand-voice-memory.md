## Brand Voice Patterns (BRV)

> Patterns about voice definition, principles, and attribute calibration.

### BRV-001: Strategic Mission Reframe During Discovery

**Pattern**: Initial content library focused on technical efficiency (token optimization, cost savings) but discovery interview revealed true mission: organizational knowledge preservation and decision intelligence. Technical efficiency became proof point, not headline.

**Context**: Agentic project, initial brand voice assessment (2026-02-23)

**Key Insight**: What users publish (v1.0 content) may not reflect what they truly value (v2.0 mission). Ask "why does this matter beyond the technical implementation?" to uncover authentic mission.

**Reconciliation Chosen**: Option B - Update content to match true mission. User chose authenticity over continuity.

**Application**: During discovery, if existing content contradicts interview answers, surface the gap explicitly and offer reconciliation options (update principles, update content, or hybrid). Don't assume technical content = technical mission.

**Related**: Principle 2 (Human Value Before Technical Proof)

**Pattern types to capture**:
- Voice principle hierarchies that work (which principles conflict most, how to resolve)
- Attribute calibration accuracy (target vs perceived gap patterns)
- Cross-brand commonalities (attributes that most brands cluster around)
- Profile completeness thresholds (minimum viable profile for useful content generation)
- Vocabulary guide effectiveness (which substitutions improve consistency measurably)

## Content Patterns (CNT)

> Patterns about content generation, channel adaptation, and format effectiveness.
> Format: CNT-NNN: [Pattern title]

*No patterns yet.*

**Pattern types to capture**:
- Hook patterns by platform (which hook types drive highest engagement per channel)
- Optimal content length by channel and audience (actual vs guideline)
- Cross-posting adaptation effectiveness (which platform pairs share content well)
- CTA performance by type (discussion vs save vs traffic vs follow)
- Template adherence vs creative deviation (when structure helps vs constrains)
- Content generation speed benchmarks (time from intent capture to publish-ready)

## Intent Patterns (INT)

> Patterns about content intent capture, which intents drive best outcomes, and intent-to-result correlations.
> Format: INT-NNN: [Pattern title]

*No patterns yet.*

**Pattern types to capture**:
- Intent clarity correlation (how well-defined intents correlate with content quality scores)
- Metric selection accuracy (which metrics were actually trackable post-publish)
- Intent-to-outcome gap (what was intended vs what performed)
- Common intent anti-patterns (vague outcomes, unmeasurable metrics, mismatched audience/channel)
- Best-performing intent combinations (which intent + channel + audience triple works best)

## Audience Patterns (AUD)

> Patterns about audience segmentation, tone calibration, and reception feedback.
> Format: AUD-NNN: [Pattern title]

*No patterns yet.*

**Pattern types to capture**:
- Tone miscalibration signals (audience feedback indicating tone was off-target)
- Audience segment response differences (same content, different reception by segment)
- Formality sweet spots by industry (which formality levels work for B2B SaaS vs enterprise vs consumer)
- Engagement triggers by audience type (what makes technical vs executive vs general audiences respond)
- Sentiment shifts over voice evolution (how audience sentiment changes as voice matures)

## Evolution Patterns (EVL)

> Patterns about voice drift, periodic review findings, and profile updates.
> Format: EVL-NNN: [Pattern title]

*No patterns yet.*

**Pattern types to capture**:
- Drift detection signals (early indicators that voice is shifting unintentionally)
- Healthy evolution vs unhealthy drift (how to distinguish intentional growth from decay)
- Review frequency effectiveness (quarterly vs monthly vs per-campaign)
- Profile update triggers (what events should prompt a voice profile revision)
- Multi-stakeholder alignment decay (how consensus degrades over time and how to refresh it)
